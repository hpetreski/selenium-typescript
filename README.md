<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project aims to display a possible UI end-to-end automation strategy when dealing with a modern video platform like Youtube.

It is leveraging the power of Selenium as a popular web automation framework, and TypeScript with its strongly typed syntax which will help us catch errors earlier during the development.

Using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, the project organizes test cases into modular and reusable components. This allows for easy maintenance, updates, and expansion of the test suite as the platform evolves.

Key Features:

- Automation of critical user interactions such as video search (login, playback, and channel navigation are planned in the future)
- Parallel execution for a faster test case execution.
- Configured linter, prettifier, and pre-commit hooks to make sure the committed code is cleaner 
- Reporting and logging mechanisms to provide detailed insights into test results and potential issues, using Allure and Spec.
- Detailed documentation in readmes and in the comments of the files.
    
As a testament to modern software development practices, this project aims to inspire confidence in quality assurance processes and contribute to the overall improvement of web application testing by following the best practices in automated testing.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Nodejs needs to be installed on your environment before running the project.

It can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org/en/download

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hpetreski/selenium-typescript.git
    ```
2. Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the project
    ```sh
    npm test
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage
#### Run tests
The project is run in parallel mode by default. It will use the spec reporter. You can run it with:
```sh
npm test
```
#### Sequential mode
The sequential mode will use the allure reporter and will serve the allure report that was generated after your test run finishes.

To run the project in the sequential mode you can run it with:
```sh
npm run test-sequential
```
#### Linter
You can also run the linter by running:
```sh
npm run lint
```
#### Prettifier
Or the prettifier by running:
```sh
npm run format
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
